## Introduction

Microsoft has a big repository of popular characters and franchises, but film and TV adaptations of its IP have been few and far between over the years. Recently, the company (Microsoft) has been thinking of venturing into producing original movies like the other well-established big players in the industry. Following this, the team at Microsoft has contracted me as a specialist to undertake research on how the movie producers in the market have been performing. As a lead `Data Scientist`, we will be exploring the types of films that have been doing the best at the box office. We will help translate the findings into actionable insights that will guide the top-level management at Microsoft's new movie studio in what types of films to venture into.

## Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

## Project Dataset

The datasets that will be used for this analysis are:-
* `title.basics.csv`
* `title.ratings.csv`
* `bom.movie_gross.csv`
* `tn.movie_budgets.csv`
* `im.db`

## Analysis and Observation

From the analysis, the following observations are clear:
* From this, it can be observed that Drama genre movies were leading in production over time.
* The five leading genres in their order are: `Drama`, `Comedy`, `Action`, `Adventure`, and `Thriller` movies. 
* On the other hand, the five least produced movie genres were `Musical`, `Western`, `War`, `Sport`, and  `Music`. 
* This observation tells a critical story for Microsoft since it appears the audience was consuming some genres more than others. However, this tells a half-story. We will need to look at the total income for the various movie genres and determine which ones had the highest gross income.

* This observation now gives a consistent story.
* As seen above, the top five movie genres that fetched the highest gross returns from the highest were `Adventure`, `Action`, `Comedy`, `Drama`, and `Animations`.
* The five genres with the least total gross were `War`, `Documentary`, `Musical`, `Western`, and `Sport`.
* The story is very consistent and proves why most producers concentrated on certain genres and not others.

## 5. Conclusion

We have managed to clean the data in use and conduct analysis in order to assist Microsoft in delivering actionable recommendations that will see them start a movies production studio that is well-informed on how the past and current trends of other studios.

From this analysis, we have seen the least-performing genres in the market. This includes `War`, `Documentary`, `Musical`, `Western`, and `Sport`.

## 6. Recommendation

* Now that we have done quite some analysis in an effort to help Microsoft Corporation make a decision on which types of movies to produce in their studio, it is clear that they should focus more on movie genres such as `Adventure`, `Action`, `Comedy`, `Drama`, and `Animations` since they are the top most when their gross returns are looked at.
* The team should not only look at the local market but focus also on the global market to increase the gross net returns.
* With a keen emphasis on the above, it is highly possible that Microsoft will be among the top producers and sellers of their movies in their upcoming studio.
