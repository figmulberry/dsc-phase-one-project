![awesome](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-phase-1-project/master/awesome.gif)

## Introduction

Microsoft has a big repository of popular characters and franchises, but film and TV adaptations of its IP have been few and far between over the years. Recently, the company (Microsoft) has been thinking of venturing into producing original movies like the other well-established big players in the industry. Following this, the team at Microsoft has contracted me as a specialist to undertake research on how the movie producers in the market have been performing. As a lead `Data Scientist`, we will be exploring the types of films that have been doing the best at the box office. We will help translate the findings into actionable insights that will guide the top-level management at Microsoft's new movie studio in what types of films to venture into.

The datasets that will be used for this analysis are:-
* `imdb.title.basics`
* `imdb.title.ratings`
* `bom.movie_gross`

## Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.
